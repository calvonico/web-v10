          Hey, I'm <strong>Nico</strong> ðŸ‘‹

        <p className="mt-1">
          I'm a entrepeneur, designer and developer passionate about building things that help people. Born and raised in Buenos Aires, and after a couple of seasons in beautiful Porto, I found home in Barcelona.
        </p>
        //<p className="mt-3">
          //For the last 14 years my work has consisted of marketing design: building creative assets for email, social media, websites, and more.
        //</p>
        //<p className="mt-3">
          //Lately I've been working as a Creative Lead, coordinating a group of designers focusing on achieving their best version to create unique and quality images and illustrations for our clients.
        //</p>
        <p className="mt-3">
          I like to travel and explore new cities; and I love watching movies, football, Formula 1 and video games.
